Singularity image for [R].

This is still a work in progress. Very much so.

## Build

You can build a local Singularity image named `singularity-r.sif` with:

```sh
sudo singularity build singularity-r.sif singularity-r.def
```

## Deploy

Instead of building it yourself you can download the pre-built image from the
[Cloud Library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library) with:

```sh
singularity pull singularity-r.sif library://nickjer/default/singularity-r:4.2.0
```

> **WARNING:** This pre-built image comes with OpenBLAS installed using the
> Debian binary packages. Be sure to run any tests with libraries that leverage
> OpenBLAS in your enviroment. If you notice any odd results it may be best to
> build this image from scratch on the machine you intend to run it on. See
> instructions under the Build section above.
>
> Or alternatively you can mount the locally installed OpenBLAS library into
> the container using...
>
> ```sh
> singularity run \
>   --bind "/path/on/host/to/libopenblas.so:/usr/lib/R/lib/libblas.so.3" \
>   singularity-r.sif
> ```
